Sometimes, we seek guidance or more information about products to help us filter based on our needs. In this technological landscape, we are often overwhelmed by the multitude of options and struggle to find the products that suit us best.

To address this challenge, we are developing a chatbot that will guide users in selecting the best laptop according to their individual needs and provide personalized assistance.
